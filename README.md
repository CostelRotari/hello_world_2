# hello_world_2
Annother trial. So I've don a change to the description, and we'll see how this will apear. when I'll try to merge the two changes.


[there is a way to atach links I saw](https://github.com/CostelRotari/hello_world_2/edit/main/README.md)

So now, after Pulling and Merging and Deleting the 1st branch, and finily, creating a 2nd branch. I'm midifiing the main branch and the 2nd branch to see what happens when I'll the try to merge everythign. This is the text before: (I'll modify it a little bit) I've created a branch to do do some work on it and then committing. I guess, now that, I'v written this line , my work is don. 
But I will also change the description ... very good.
