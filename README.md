# hello_world_2
Annother trial... Let's say this is the 2nd. So I've don a change to the description, and we'll see how this will apear. when I'll try to merge the two changes.


[there is a way to atach links I saw](https://github.com/CostelRotari/hello_world_2/edit/main/README.md)

I've created a branch do do some work on it without committing. I guess, now that, I ve written this line , my work is don. 
But I will also change the description

So I'm working actualy on a subproblem and I'm, let's say, adding some staff. also I'll modifie somethig of the old text as you have already nodiced, I immagine. 

So this is my work on the branch and I will like to Pull il ... is strange because youll think I ll say Push it ... insted . I'dd like to push it for review... Of course I don't have any idea of the changes on the main branch. so who does the review... what he will do? will see.
